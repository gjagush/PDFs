When I was 18, I slipped into a bout of delusion / schizophrenia. Maybe due to eating plain spaghetti every single night and every day for lunch.

Eventually it peaked, and I was forced into a mental hospital. The hospital had all kinds of people, from my age up to 40 or 50-ish. There were signs with rules like how you shouldn't discuss your meds. I hung out with a few of the younger kids, and to this day I'm not sure why any of them were in there. But I was so delusional, I thought I was perfectly healthy, too.

There were also little motivational posters, like they have in schools. One of them was a wizard with a robe and a long grey beard, and a wand in his right hand. He was posed over the text, "People are strange."

This post reminds me of that poster. People are strange.
