For weeks at a time, I would lie awake at night. Listening, waiting, wondering. I would lie there and stare at the ceiling, one question swimming through my mind, ceaselessly. No matter how hard I tried, I could not stop asking this question. And no matter how much I asked it, I could not find the answer. "Is this.... the Krusty Krab?" Am I in a place where I will be happy for the rest of my life? Can I continue the endless monotony of bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order, or one day will I forget the pickles? Is this the Krusty Krab? After countless hours awake at night, asking myself this question, I think I have finally discovered the answer. This is not the Krusty Krab.

No.
