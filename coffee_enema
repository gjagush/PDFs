Some of my relatives were into coffee enemas. While living in a rural area sharing temporary housing with his employees one of my uncles left out a batch of coffee to cool. His employees had learned of this fetish and spiked it with a bottle of tabasco sauce. He returned and vanished into the bathroom to do the deed. In a few minutes loud groans could be heard from the bathroom. Uncle emerged half an hour later and said to the employee, "Hey guy, I know you put pepper sauce in my coffee". Everyone burst out laughing. By the way, these guys are strict vegetarians, no smoking, no drinking and no coffee. Strangely enough they claim that a coffee enema is not the same since the coffee doesn't actually go through your system. Personally, I like to drink mine with cream and honey. I don't understand wasting good coffee on my ass when it can't taste it.
