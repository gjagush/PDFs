I only have one thing that could really be described as a fetish, but truth be told, it isn't very easy to explain. I guess I haven't really named it, but I guess you would call it a fetish for pretending it is Halloween whenever I visit a fast food establishment.

To give an example or two, yesterday I went to Subway and ordered a "Spooky Italian" and when they asked if I wanted it toasted, I said "yes, I would like it GHOSTed." It made me really sexually excited I guess. I don't think the workers in any of the restaurants have ever said anything; maybe they think I am just mentally disturbed. Another example would be whenever I visit Burger King, I order a "WhoopAAAAHHH" and make sure to shout the "AAHHH" slightly to make the person behind the counter jump back slightly. 

I am pretty fucking fat and when I was a kid I only ever had friends on Halloween when someone needed a Jabba the Hut or Giant Blob Monster in their party group so I think combining the two things I like (having friends as a kid, and good), gets me sexually aroused. I'm pretty into public masturbation as well, but generally, I can only masturbate to public fapping videos if I am listening to Monster Mash or something.
