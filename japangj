Hi,

My wife and I are traveling to Tokyo soon and have looked everywhere online about the love hotels but can't find an answer for our specific question.

I know that most love hotels are very respectful of their guest's privacy, and you often don't interact with an actual person upon check-in and check out. And that often the door will stay closed until you pay.

Do they actually check the rooms though when you leave, and make you pay for any cleanup etc?

Reason I ask is both my wife and I are into watersports (for lack of a better terminology, we like to pee and poop on each other and the bed) and were wondering if we would incur any extra cleanup fees for this?

We would of course shower and clean ourselves off before leaving the love hotel, but wanted to know if there would be any extra fees involved?

We are traveling on a budget so are trying to keep any unnecessary expenses as low as possible.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Before lots of of you think I'm a troll. I can assure you I'm not, and it's hard enough living in secret with this fetish, never mind when you try to be upfront about it and people don't believe you. 

I have just PMed some pictures of my wife and I playing to OP and he can verify if this is for real or not.
