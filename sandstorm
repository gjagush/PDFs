Have you ever been in a Sandstorm? Apparently not. Allow me to explain. It starts off with a clap from the distance. Just than the sand begins swirling around you in a dancing motion... You feel nothing, but the sound is almost addicting. Than it comes. Those first sharp grains of sand come and you know it is over for you. Pow pow pow pow pow. It's as if they strike your soul! POW pow pow pow pow pow. Again they hit with the melody of ten thousand grains. It begins to build faster and faster! Pow pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow pow, powpowpowpowpow powpowpowpow powpowpowpowpowpowpowpowpowpow. And than like the cruel bitch she is, she stops... swirling around you once again. Only to repeat the process. And this time it doesn't stop, as if sand was being fired from a 136 bpm machine gun right at your ears, and that's when you realize it. Your legs can't stop moving. Many people think you die from the suffocation of the storm, but it's the dancing that'll kill you. Ask any sandstorm survivor and they'll tell you the same. What Darude has done for us is capture and release it over the years to build up our tolerance for the sandstorms. I bet you've never even heard of a sandstorm death. Ever since the songs release we've been unconsciously trained to survive, adapt, and nullify the effects. We've been so engrained by the song (pun intended) that whenever a sandstorm does come around, we immediately perceive it as simple, legendary music, but listen... And feel. Next time you hear sandstorm as your walking down the street reach out and feel. If you try hard enough, you just might feel a grain of sand, and you'll know that Darude has saved your life. Thank you Darude. We fear the sand no more!!
