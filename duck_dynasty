I feel like a Duck Dynasty guy living in a Miley Cyrus world. And to be perfectly honest with you, I feel like I'm getting twerked on by Washington DC. 

It's really no surprise that I identify with Mr. Phil and Miss Kay and Uncle Si. We're all Southern. And like the Robertsons, I'm proud to call myself a gun-toting, sweet-tea-drinking, Bible-clinging American. 

President Obama calls us bitter, but I prefer to be called blessed. Besides, the only reason we're clinging to our guns and our Bibles and our jugs of sweet tea is because we're afraid he's going to take them away from us. 

We're a peculiar people. That's how the Bible describes us. My Uncle Jerry, from Coldwater, Mississippi, fancies himself to be an armchair theologian. He said the literal interpretation of the passage means, "I'm an odd duck."

Well, quack, quack, quack, baby. 

I grew up in a much simpler time - when blackberry was a pie and dirty dancing meant somebody forgot to clean out the barn for the square dance. It was a time when father still knew best - when the girls were girls and the men were men. I grew up in a time when a rainbow was a sign of God's promise, not gay rights. 

When I grew up, spam was something you ate and a hard drive was the twelve-hour trip to grandma's house without any bathroom breaks. It was a time when a virus was cleared up with a bowl of chicken soup.
