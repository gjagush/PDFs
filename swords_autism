Why do people automatically associate swords with autism? I have a vast sword collection, mostly Asian and Old Norse blades which seem to be the main issues, and I don't understand how this makes me autistic. I'm a virgin, yes, but swords actually make me MORE likely to get laid. I have had countless conversations with cute, cute girls in my classes about the weapons I own. I have been able to speak to women for the first time because they want to know about my Viking Sword, or my latest Bamboo handled Katana. I dream of meeting a girl called Anya so I can say "I own a Katana but I want a cute Anya", that is when I will lose my virginity. But I'm not autistic. I buy these swords to use as often as I can. I have many friends.
