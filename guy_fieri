Reminds me of this one guy who used to work in our kitchen. That guy was an absolute fucking mess. I don't even know how he didn't get fired during his first service. Anyway, the guy was messy, disorganised, clumsy, his was slow, his technique was bad and he always got in the way of everybody, he was basically a man-child. Of course, he went to culinary school. He was like one of those fucknuts from Hell's Kitchen. I don't even know how the fuck he got hired. He was a mess. Anyway one slow day, a quite thin woman came through the door of the kitchen and wanted to see her Son. It was a slow day, but the restaurant still had people and we had to cook. So this fuck just stopped what he was doing and went to his Mom. We were in the middle of service and he just stopped what he was doing. And his Mom gave him a kiss on the mouth and hugged him. He introduced her as his mom, and of course no one fucking cared. I told him to get back into service but he left with his Mom. Can you believe that shit? And he didn't come back until tomorrow. Somehow, he wasn't fired. I think he had a connection with the owner of the restaurant or some shit like that. Anyway, he went on to open a few restaurants and got a deal with the food network. I think his name was Guy Fieri or something.
