This reminds me of my old method of passive aggressive means of getting back at the upper management at the corporation where I worked. I was a Union Millwright, and as such, in the summer especially, I generated a nice little amount of ass cheese each day. When I saw that one of these humpty's was going to want to shake my hand, I would surrepticiously slip my hand down into my pants and between my ass cheeks, covering them with a nice coating of ass cheese that had a terrible smell that you literally could not wash off. Wives could even think they had been screwing an old stinky ho, it smelled so sexually smelly. I would just occasionally get to see one of them sniffing the air as they walked away, that really gave me my jollies!
