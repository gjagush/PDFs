Check out *[Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/1),* a CDC study in response to the President's executive orders after Sandy Hook.

Key takeaways from the report:

* Armed citizens are less likely to be injured by an attacker: ["Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns \(i.e., incidents in which a gun was “used” by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender\) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies \(Kleck, 1988; Kleck and DeLone, 1993; Southwick, 2000; Tark and Kleck, 2004\)."](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15)

* People defend themselves with guns very often: ["Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million \(Kleck, 2001a\), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 \(BJS, 2010\)."](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15)

* Mass shootings are a tiny fraction of firearms deaths: ["The number of public mass shootings of the type that occurred at Sandy Hook Elementary School accounted for a very small fraction of all firearm-related deaths. Specifically, since 1983 there have been 78 events in which 4 or more individuals were killed by a single perpetrator in 1 day in the United States, resulting in 547 victims and 476 injured persons \(Bjelopera et al., 2013\)."](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#13)

* Accidental gun deaths are a tiny fraction of accidental deaths: ["Unintentional firearm-related deaths have steadily declined during the past century.27 The number of unintentional deaths due to firearm-related incidents accounted for less than 1 percent of all unintentional fatalities in 2010 \(Hoyert and Xu, 2012\)."](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#30)

* Gun buy-backs don't work: ["There is empirical evidence that gun turn-in programs are ineffective, as noted in the 2005 NRC study Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review."](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#44)

* Very few crimes are committed with stolen guns or guns bought at guns shows - most guns are acquired via family and friends: ["According to a 1997 survey of inmates, approximately 70 percent of the guns used or possessed by criminals at the time of their arrest came from family or friends,drug dealers, street purchases, or the underground market \(Harlow, 2001\)."](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#32) 

* Most gun deaths aren't homicide, but suicide, which seems to point towards a different sort of problem: ["Between the years 2000 and 2010, firearm-related suicides significantly outnumbered homicides for all age groups, annually accounting for 61 percent of the more than 335,600 people who died from firearm-related violence in the United States."](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#32)
